# `Express Generator CLI for React with Typescript, Apollo GraphQL Client and Material UI`

This CLI helps to create new implemented front-end demo for React with Typescript, Apollo GraphQL Client and Material UI from a boilerplate.
To have a Full Stack project, or to test created demo, you can setup graphql server with using [Express Generator CLI for Graphql Backend]

## `About the NPM Package`
### Package Installation
```sh
npm install -g express-generator-react-typescript-material-apollo-graphql
```

### Package Usage
Go to the directory on terminal where you want to generate the project.
```sh
$ cd PATH
```
and run the generator command with specifying the project name.
```sh
$ express-generator-rtmag --name="PROJECT_NAME"
```

## `Documentation for the Boilerplate`
When you generate the project, you will have;

### Tech Stack

* [Node.js]
* [Typescript]
* [GraphQL Apollo Client]
* [Material UI]
* [Global Store Manager]

### Features

* GraphQL Queries with implementations in Typescript for Demo User Entity
* GraphQL Mutations with implementations in Typescript for Demo User Entity
* CRUD operations in Typescript for Demo User Entity
* Full Ready CRUD Demo User Components: User List Component, Single User Component, User Dialog Component

### Architecture
This boilerplate has common graphql client design architecture. 
**Layers:**
* ***Components*** holds component implementations 
* ***Models*** holds document interfaces and schema models
* ***Mutations*** holds basic mutation scripts to send graphql server; create, update, delete
* ***Queries*** holds basic query scripts to send graphql server; retrieve

### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies:

```sh
$ cd <Project Name>
$ npm install
```

Set configuration parameters on **config/index.ts**:
```sh
GRAPHQL_URL: "{{GRAPHQL API URL}}"
```

And that's all, start the client
```sh
$ npm start
```

## `Documentation for the Generator Project`
### Tech Stack
